# Myra Security Terraform Provider documentation

> **Note:** This documentation is under active development. In case something is missing that you would like to use, feel free to create a new issue describing your usecase. 

Using HashiCorp's "Infrastructure as Code" tool, it is possible to configure/manage Myracloud elements/configurations in source code. Like this, it is easily possible to track and version your changes and - in case you need it - do a rollback to some previous state.

Using terraform is an easy way to communicate with the existing Myracloud API.

The purpose of this documentation project is to show some scenarios about how to use the Myra Security Terraform Provider
